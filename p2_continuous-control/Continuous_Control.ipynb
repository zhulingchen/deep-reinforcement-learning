    "\n",
    "Most of the advises are quite fruitful, except that I commented out the **Attempt 3** which restricts the norm of the gradients to 1 when updating the weights of the Critic network. Instead, I plugged in one `nn.BatchNorm1d` layer after the first `nn.Linear` layer for both Actor and Critic to reduce ill effects of the internal covariance shift within the networks. By such means I can increase the learning rate to 1e-3 for both networks to accelerate the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I updated both networks 3 times after every 5 steps. By combining such efforts, I can achieve the goal that the agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes, and over all 20 agents) of at least 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in order to deal with the exploration-exploitation trade-off, I introduced a value of $\\epsilon$ during training and the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck noise will be added to `actions` with probability $\\epsilon$. This is a strategy similar to $\\epsilon$-greedy policies. The probability $\\epsilon$ is decayed by 1e-5 per step until it reaches its lower bound 0.05."
